Exceptions:

CHECKED EXCEPTIONS
UN-CHECKED EXCEPTIONS -> RuntimeExceptions

IF YOU WANT TO CREATE ANY CUSTOM EXCEPTION IN JAVA, ALWAYS EXTEND RuntimeException.


YOU CANNOT JUST IGNORE CHECKED EXCEPTIONS.
YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THEM SOONER OR LATER.
IF YOU IGNORE THEM FOR TIME BEING, IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CALLER METHOD TO HANDLE IT.


throws vs throw

throws is used to ignore the exception
throw is used to throw a new exception.


try -> should contain as much less code as possible. in fact, it should only contain the problematic code.
catch -> while writing catch blocks, the way we catch exceptions should be as follows: most specific to least specific.


All exceptions in java arise from `Throwable`
Throwable
