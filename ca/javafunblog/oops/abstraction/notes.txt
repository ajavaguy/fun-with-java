abstract -> keyword

Since an abstract class can have abstract (incomplete or methods with no
definition) methods, Java will not let us instantiate an abstract class.

It is the responsibility of the inheriting class to provide the definition of
the abstract method.


A class which is defined as abstract, may or may not have an abstract method.
A class which has at least one abstract method should be made abstract. no way
around it.
