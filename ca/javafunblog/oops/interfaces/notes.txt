An interface has to be implemented.
An interface provides a contract.


JavaEE -> functionality
any framework arises from -> JavaEE
they just make our job easier to use JavaEE.
JavaEE -> is a contract provided by the oracle corp
Java web app -> to transfer an object over the network, we need some classes.
they are inside a package called javax.
javax -> interfaces -> provides implementation (classes)
quarkus -> I also provide an implementation to the interfaces defined in javax
package.

I don't want to use the implementation provided in some x
but I want to provide my own implementation.
the ultimate goal is to send an object over the network
interfaces -> this is a base contract provided by one organization
so, if we want to develop some functionality, we have to abide by that contract.



ALWAYS CODE TO AN INTERFACE
